# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 6th, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Enrolled in The Odin Project's, "Ruby On Rails Full Stack," curriculum. I completed 34% of the Wed Development 101 course. Notably, I installed Xubuntu onto VMWare; I created an SSH Key on github to allow commits from the terminal; I watched Corey Schaffer's Git Tutorial for Beginners;
**Thoughts:** I am glad to be done with the installation process and look forward to reviewing the front end tomorrow as this is an area I am comfortable with, but want to push forward and learn more. 

Tomorrow I will be able to share links to my work, having nothing to show for today's work other than the creation of the SSH Key that is the going to be used for the entirety of the curriculum :)



### Day 1: October 7th, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Git Basics Project on the Odin Project and started a new project creating the google homepage. I also reviewed html, css, and git. I read, "How to write a Git message," and learned how to format a Git message.

**Thoughts:** Creating the google homepage will be a challenge, however, I am excited to use my html and CSS knowledge and create a project. 

### Day 2: October 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I created an html skeleton for The Odin Project's, "Google homepage project." I also created a CSS file for external styling. 

**Thoughts**: Learning Chrome Dev Tools is helping me understand the basics of tools. This project is challenging me, but also motivating me because I can see how much I need to learn to become a developer. I look forward to looking back seeing how far I've come by challenging myself daily! 

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
